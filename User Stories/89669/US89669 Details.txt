New CM descriptions needed for April 1st

DESCRIPTION

Please add the following codes and code descriptions to the regression databases and debuggers (UD and V2).

Per CM Rally Story: US89412
Three new diagnosis codes for reporting COVID-19 vaccination status will go into effect April 1, 2022. The codes were presented by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the Sept. 14-15, ICD-10 Coordination and Maintenance Committee meeting, so they are not listed in the 2022 ICD-10-CM code book.

The new ICD-10-CM codes for reporting COVID-19 vaccination status are:
Z28.310    Unvaccinated for COVID-19
Z28.311    Partially vaccinated for COVID-19
Z28.39     Other underimmunization status

The ICD-10 Medicare Code Editor Version 39.1 will include these codes in its edits to validate correct coding on claims for discharges on or after April 1, 2022.

	-- SERVER: CACALQDBENT001

	USE ACTUS_NLP_ICD10

	-- This is the valid set of ICD10CM codes.  You need to add the three new codes to this table.
	SELECT * FROM LUICD10DiagnosisCodes WHERE TerminationDate IS NULL AND Invalid = 0



NOTES

You'll need to update the code descriptions in these files:
https://github.optum.com/clinical-language-intelligence/debuggers/blob/master/UnifiedDebugger/CodeDefinitions/yost_icd10.txt
https://github.optum.com/clinical-language-intelligence/debuggers/blob/tools/Debuggers_Beta/NLPDebuggerV2/NLPDebuggerv2/data/ICD_10_cm_desc.txt

And you'll have to update a table in the database.  See the attached sql file.
